# Short description of what you attempted to build
We wanted to build a pdf reader for people who were in a time crunch. The PDF is ultimately supposed to make an annoying sound/flashing lights when the user leaves the application and a future iteration should alert the user's 'buddy' who would then presumably pressure their friend to get back to work. We wanted to build the pdf reader using Electron which is based on react but allows you to build Desktop Applications.

# Who did what (if you worked with someone else)
Manzi Bryan: Worked on designing the UI of the application, built the front end of the landing page and set up the system for sending the path of the PDFs chosen by the user (or the URL to the PDF reader).

Abubakar Kasule: Worked on the UI/UX of the application as well. He also built the PDF reader and handled the routing from the front end to the actual PDF reader. 

# What you learned
We learned how to work with Electron, how to interact with computer file systems which is surprisingly difficult and also learned 

# What didnâ€™t work
We weren't able to figure out how to make a sound/flashing lights when the user leaves the screen and because we prioritized that over the "buddy" system, we haven't implemented the buddy system either.
